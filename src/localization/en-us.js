      'A few days before when I was coding this page I read a interesting question in a recruting process:',
    question: 'What is, in your view, a good engeneering culture?',
    comment: `I've decided to share my answer here`,
    answer: `IMO a good engeneering culture is developer and goal centered, by that I mean the developers must have autonomy and confidence to develop solutions in a wellthy way, maintaining an equilibrium between more challenging and simpler tasks, aiming to achieve a good work-life balance to be able to focus where it's most important and delivery the expected value aligned with deadlines and good code quality`,

      'At my college I was more like a backend developer, nowadays I can see it helps me as a frontend developer to pair with my backend teammates, just like working in a so diverse environmnet as game development helps me communicate better with non technical people like designers and PMs/POs',
    presentation3:
      'I love to share knowledge and learn new stuff, tech or not. Some of my preferred topics are: sports, specially basketball, videogames and boardgames, finances, sci-fi and random stuff like coffee history or why people behave like behave',

    presentation1: `I'm a frontend developer focused on VueJs, I chose Vue as my main stack because I enjoyed the code styling, it's less opinative (like react), but easier to read and understand (without JSX). Since my college in IT I had interest in programming best practices, design patterns (even not calling by it) and believer in the concept of having descriptive class, variables and methods names are good enough and more productive than spreading comments everywhere`,
    presentation2: `I've started my dev career looking towards game development with Unity and C# and a java backend developer, but after my first job opportunity ♪ I fall in love with the shape of Vue ♪ and frontend. Because my backend background at college I can pair with my backend teammates and find the best place to put our solution (client vs server side), just like working with 2D/3D artists, sound and game designers as game developer helped me to communicate better with product and design teammates`,
    presentation3: `I'm very communicative, (I believe you noticed it by this website), active in meetings and offering my opinion on solutions and proposals - topdown way isn't my way. I love sharing knowledge, build relations and contribute to the work environment be pleasant and safe for everyone`,
